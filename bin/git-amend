# Git Manpage
#   --amend
#     Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The recorded tree is prepared as usual
#     (including the effect of the -i and -o options and explicit pathspec), and the message from the original
#     commit is used as the starting point, instead of an empty message, when no other message is specified from
#     the command line via options such as -m, -F, -c, etc. The new commit has the same parents and author as
#     the current one (the --reset-author option can countermand this).
#
#   -C <commit>, --reuse-message=<commit>
#     Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message and the authorship information (including the
#     timestamp) when creating the commit.
#
git commit --amend -C HEAD
